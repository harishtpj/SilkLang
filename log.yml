Date Started: 17 January, 2024
Note : |
  This log is written as a way to track the progress of the project.
  Since this project takes a very long time to complete, logging the progress of
  this project is helpful when developing later.

  This reference implementation is written in C, in accordance with the clox language.

Development workflow: |
  Since the documentation for the Silk language is not yet fully completed(as of writing),
  the development workflow of the project should be as follows:

    - Create documentation for the implemented part of language.
    - Implement that part of the language.
    - If any errors, or bugs, create an issue until the problem is fixed.
    - Make sure that the documentation is in accordance with the implementation.
