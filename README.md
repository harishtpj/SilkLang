# SilkLang

Welcome to the repository of the **Silk** Language, the reference implementation of the **HCLAN** language.

# About
Silk is an **Interpreted, Object Oriented** language written in C. It is also **dynamically typed** and has a 
very **modern syntax**, much similar to Java and Python. This interpreter is inspired from [cLox of Crafting 
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This project is intended to be the reference implementation of the [HCLAN](https://github.com/harishtpj/HCLAN) language since the latter is written in Java, which has several performance issues regarding the speed.

# Requirements
- Any ANSI-C compiler (latest version is more preferable)

# Installation
<!--TODO: Complete this-->

# Usage
To run your first program, fire up you favourite text editor and copy the following lines to `hello.slk` file:
```silk
# A Simple Hello, World! program

print "Hello, world!";
print "HCLAN is interesting!";
```

Then open a new terminal in the same directory as the file and run:
```bash
$ silk hello.slk
```

For windows users: just run the same command.

You'll see the following output on your terminal:

```
Hello, world!
HCLAN is interesting!
```
